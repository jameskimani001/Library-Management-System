Library Management System
Author: James Kimani
Date: 17-12-2024

## Overview
The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to help manage books, authors, borrowers, and borrowed books. It integrates with a MySQL database to store data and provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for performing various library operations.

## Features
Manage Books: Add, view, update, and delete books in the library.
Manage Authors: Add, view, update, and delete authors.
Manage Borrowers: Add, view, update, and delete borrowers.
Manage Borrowed Books: Borrow and return books, view borrowed books.
Prerequisites
Before using the system, ensure that the following software is installed:

Python 3.x
Install Python 3.x if itâ€™s not already installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website here.

MySQL
MySQL (version 5.7 or higher recommended) is required. To install MySQL, follow the steps below:

## On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
## Once installed, start MySQL:
Copy code
sudo systemctl start mysql
## Secure the MySQL installation:
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Set a password for the MySQL root user when prompted.

## MySQL Connector for Python
You need the mysql-connector-python package to interact with MySQL in Python. To install it, run:
Copy code
pip install mysql-connector-python
Installation Steps
1. Install MySQL Server
Follow the installation steps mentioned above under the "MySQL" section to install MySQL on your system.

2. Install Python and Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, install it as follows:
Copy code
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
## Next, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install MySQL connector for Python
pip install mysql-connector-python
3. Create the Database and Tables
## Log into MySQL to create the database and the required tables:
Copy code
sudo mysql -u root -p
## Once logged in, execute the following SQL commands:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE LibraryManagementSystem;

USE LibraryManagementSystem;

CREATE TABLE authors (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id)
);

CREATE TABLE borrowers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE borrowed_books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    borrower_id INT,
    borrow_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (borrower_id) REFERENCES borrowers(id)
);
4. Configure MySQL Connection
Ensure that the MySQL connection details are correctly set in the code (in db.py or a similar file):

python
Copy code
import mysql.connector

def get_connection():
    """Establish and return a connection to the MySQL database."""
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host='localhost',
        database='LibraryManagementSystem',  # Database name
        user='root',  # MySQL user
        password='1234'  # MySQL password
    )
    return connection
5. Run the Application
Once your database is set up, and the dependencies are installed, run the main.py file to launch the interactive CLI:
Copy code
python3 main.py
